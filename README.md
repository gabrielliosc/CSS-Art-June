This is a submission for Frontend Challenge v24.04.17, CSS Art: June. https://dev.to/challenges/frontend-2024-05-29

For the June frontend challenge, I got inspired by the celebration of diversity once it's the pride month.

To add the confetti effect I used an open-source library called tsparticles, to see its code you can check here: https://github.com/tsparticles/tsparticles
